This tutorial shows how to deploy a Vaadin web application to Heroku cloud. Heroku provides free cloud deployment for up to 5 Vaadin Java applications. You can find more infromation on their https://www.heroku.com/[website].

We're using the latest https://vaadin.com/start/latest[Spring Boot starter app] as an example. You can see the app running on Heroku cloud https://starter-vaadin.herokuapp.com/[here]. You can deploy the application directly from your command line or from a GitHub repository.

NOTE: 

* Verify that you hava Java installed by running the command `java --version` in your terminal. If no Java version is found, https://www.java.com/en/download/[download] and install the latest version on your computer it and configure it to the https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml[*PATH*] if you're running Windows.
* Verify that you have Git installed by running the command `git --version` in your terminal. If no Git version is found, download and install the https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[latest version] on your computer.

== Deploying from command line

=== Generating a JAR

A *JAR* (Java ARchive) is a package file that merges Java class files and assiociated metadata and resources, such as text and images, into one distributable file. This is the default format for you Vaadin app if you have created it from https://vaadin.com/start. To upload the `.jar` to Heroku cloud:

. Create a Heroku account at https://www.heroku.com/home.
. Install https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install[Heroku CLI] and login to your Heroku account.
. Install the *Java CLI plugin* by running the command `heroku plugins:install java` in your terminal.
. Download and open the starter project from http://vaadin.com/start/latest. Select *Spring Boot* as the Technology Stack and fill the *Maven Group ID* and *Project Name* as you see fit (or leave them at default).
. Change the `server.port` in your Spring projectâ€™s `application.properties` file residing in `src/main/resources` to: `server.port=${port:8080}` (detailed instructions on the https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto.html#howto-change-the-location-of-external-properties[Spring website]).
. Generate a `.jar` from your application using the maven goal `mvn package -Pproduction`
. Navigate to the folder with the generated `.jar` (usually found under filepath `/target`)

=== Creating a Heroku application

. Create a Heroku application by either:
+
.. Running `heroku create APP_NAME` in the Java CLI plugin
+
or
+
.. By selecting *New* in the UI under https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps.
. Name your Heroku application. You will need the name in the next step.
. Deploy the `.jar` using the command: `heroku deploy:jar my-app.jar --app APP_NAME` by replacing "APP_NAME" with the name you provided in the previous step.
. Run `heroku open --app APP_NAME` or check the URL of the deployed app under *Domains*: https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/APP_NAME/settings.

You can find the demo running at: https://starter-vaadin.herokuapp.com/

NOTE: You can open the application log by running the command: `heroku logs --tail --app APP_NAME` in your terminal for troubleshooting any possible errors.

=== Deploying WAR file

You can also choose to deploy the application in the `.war` format instead of the `.jar`. The process is similar with two exceptions:

. Change the package to from `.jar` to `.war` in the `pom.xml`
. The command to execute in step 11 is: `heroku war:deploy myapp.war --app APP_NAME`

Link to documentation: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/configuring-war-deployment-with-the-heroku-toolbelt[Configuring WAR Deployment with the Heroku CLI]

You can find the demo running at: https://starter-vaadin-war.herokuapp.com/

== Setting up a GitHub CI pipeline

You can deploy an application directly from GitHub repository with some tweaks. 

=== Configuring the project

. Start by creating a `heroku-settings.xml` file that instructs Maven what profiles should be enabled by default. Add the following content to the file:
+
.`*heroku-settings.xml*`
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"
          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd">

    <!-- activate by setting the MAVEN_SETTINGS_PATH config var to heroku-settings.xml in Heroku project settings tab.
    See https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-a-custom-maven-settings-xml for more details.
     -->

    <activeProfiles>
        <activeProfile>production</activeProfile>
        <activeProfile>npm</activeProfile>
    </activeProfiles>
</settings>
----
+
. The profiles are called `npm` and `production`. The `production` profile is included in the project by default, but the `npm` profile must be configured. Add the following section to your `<profiles>` in the `pom.xml`:
+
.`*pom.xml*`
[source,xml]
----
<profile>
            <id>npm</id>
            <build>
                <plugins>
                 <plugin>
                    <groupId>com.github.eirslett</groupId>
                    <artifactId>frontend-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                    <!-- Use the latest released version:
                    https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/github/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin/ -->
                    <version>1.9.1</version>
                    <executions>
                        <execution>
                            <id>install node and npm</id>
                            <goals>
                                <goal>install-node-and-npm</goal>
                            </goals>
                            <!-- optional: default phase is "generate-resources" -->
                            <phase>generate-resources</phase>
                        </execution>
                    </executions>
                    <configuration>
                        <nodeVersion>v12.13.0</nodeVersion>
                    </configuration>
                    </plugin>
                </plugins>
            </build>
        </profile>
----
+
. You then need to create a `Procfile` to the root directory of your application to instruct Heroku what to run on start-up. Create a file named `Procfile` with the following content:
+
`web: java -jar target/PROJECT_NAME-PROJECT_VERSION.jar $PORT`
+
and add it to the folder with the `pom.xml` file. In our case the `PROJECT_NAME-PROJECT_VERSION.jar` is called `starter_app-2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`, but this will change based on your version and name defined in the `pom.xml` file.

. Finally, push the code to your Github repository.

=== Deploying to Heroku

. Head over to Heroku and create a new app by selecting *New* in the UI under https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps.

. Connect the GitHub repository where your application is uploaded to the app you just created.

. Set the `MAVEN_SETTINGS_PATH` Config Var to `heroku-settings`.xml in Heroku project settings tab.
+
image::maven-settings-path.png[Project settings tab]
+
. Check the URL of the deployed app under *Domains*: https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/APP_NAME/settings. The application should be running there.
